This is a sample of my work. It's not incredibly impressive I know, but this was the quickest thing I could get up in such a short time. Please visit:
www.ecohorizonenergy.com for a good feel for my talents. That site was built by me with some help from a javascript guru. (I didn't do ALL the javascript)

Removed database information to insure the code works.
Removed some files that did not need to be shown (Not finished)
